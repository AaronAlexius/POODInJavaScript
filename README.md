## Exploring Practical Object Oriented Design using JavaScript

### Use case
This is specifically for study of Sandi Metz's *Practical Object Oriented Programming*.
However, I haven't learned Ruby yet, and I haven't seen a ton of examples of *POODR* in ES6 JS.
So, if you're reading POODR, but you write in JS, maybe this can help.

### Technologies used
I have found the VSCode plugin Quokka to be very helpful as a tool for thinking 
through code and seeing immediate results.  
Quokka creates another tab in VSCode, so if you wanted to test or play around
with this code, then paste the contents of a file into your own Quokka tab.
Quokka can be found here:
